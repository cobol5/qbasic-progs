A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
A CAT AND DOG LIFE
A CAT ON HOT BRICKS
A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK
A CLOSE SHAVE
A COCK AND BULL STORY
A DOG WITH TWO TAILS
A RED RAG TO A BULL
A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS
A SNAKE IN THE GRASS
A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE
A TALL TALE
A WHITE ELEPHANT
BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH
BIRDS OF A FEATHER, FLOCK TOGETHER
BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER
BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS
CAUGHT RED HANDED
FACE THE MUSIC
GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE, FOOLS SELDOM DIFFER
IN THE NICK OF TIME
LETTING THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG
LIKE A BEAR WITH A SORE HEAD
ONCE IN BLUE MOON
ONE'S BREAD AND BUTTER
SHEDDING CROCODILE TEARS
THE APPLE OF ONE'S EYE
THE LION'S SHARE
TO BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH
TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR
TO BURY THE HATCHET
TO COOK ONE'S GOOSE
TO HOLD ONE'S TONGUE
TO KICK THE BUCKET
TO TAKE FRENCH LEAVE
TO TELL A WHITE LIE
